加权 classification怎么工作的，问题就是比如这个分类是分层的，如何惩罚远距离
Classification can get much more complicated than just binary or multiclass classification. 
For instance, there are some variants of classification addressing hierarchically structured classes. 
In such cases not all errors are equal—if we must err, we might prefer to misclassify to a related class rather than a distant class.
 Usually, this is referred to as hierarchical classification. For inspiration, you might think of Linnaeus, who organized fauna in a hierarchy.

In the case of animal classification, it might not be so bad to mistake a poodle for a schnauzer, but our model would pay a huge penalty if it confused a poodle with a dinosaur.
 Which hierarchy is relevant might depend on how you plan to use the model. For example, rattlesnakes and garter snakes might be close on the phylogenetic tree, but mistaking a rattler 
 for a garter could have fatal consequences.
